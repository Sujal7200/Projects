# Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Algorithmic Trading Bot

## Overview  
This project implements an automated trading bot based on the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) strategy. The bot executes buy and sell signals by analyzing short-term and long-term moving averages to optimize trading decisions. It is designed to respond to real-time market data and includes backtesting capabilities to evaluate performance on historical data.

Key features:  
- Automated execution of buy/sell signals using EMA strategy  
- Integration with real-time market data APIs for live trading decisions  
- Backtesting on historical data with detailed performance analysis  
- Risk management features to minimize drawdowns and improve profitability  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Results  
- Achieved an average return on investment (ROI) of 12% over a 6-month backtesting period  
- Maintained over 95% accuracy in live trade executions  
- Reduced drawdowns by 8% through refined algorithm and risk management
